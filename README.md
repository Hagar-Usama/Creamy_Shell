## Introduction
Linux has it own lovely terminal! Why not to make our own?

We are trying to implement a Unix shell program. Making use of **execvp**, **fork** and other system calls, we get familiar with **processes** and **threads**.

**Creamy Shell** is called so to show our love 💖 to the profession, how grateful for, and passionate about. 😊

---
## Technologies

Three libraries are mainly used (in C++):
* *regex*: text manipulation (you may just use **strtok**)
* *unistd*: for execvp calls
* *signals*: for signal handling
